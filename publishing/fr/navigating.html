				<p>The Accessible Publishing Knowledge Base covers a wide range of topics related to the
					production of accessible digital publications. In less technical terms, there are a lot
					of pages of information on this site.</p>
				
				<p>To help ease locating information, these are two primary means of locating information:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Manually searching the <a href="topics.html">topic index</a> for the site.</li>
					<li>Using the <a href="search/">site search feature</a> for a deeper scan of the content.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The best place to start looking for information is in the topic index as the topics are grouped 
					into categories based on shared themes to make it easier to locate information.</p>
					
				<p>The following list provides a brief explanation of each of the major topical categories:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Accessibility Conformance</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="conformance/">accessibility conformance topics</a> provide information on meeting
							the various accessibility standards that apply to digital publications, such as the EPUB 
							Accessibility specification and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>EPUB</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="epub/">EPUB topics</a> cover issues that are unique to the EPUB format.
							Accessibility  requirements of the EPUB package document will be found in this section, 
							for example.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Navigation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="navigation/">navigation topics</a> describe how to author accessible 
							navigation aids such as the table of contents and page list.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="metadata/">metadata topics</a> describe the accessibility properties 
							available in widely used metadata standards such as schema.org and ONIX.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>HTML</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="html/">HTML topics</a> cover a broad range of issues related to producing
							accessible HTML content. Guidelines include how to use elements and attributes accessibly,
							how to create common publishing structures such as indexes and glossaries accessibly, and
							how to apply ARIA roles, states, and properties.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>CSS</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="css/">CSS topics</a> cover the accessible styling of content. These
							include issues with color perception, contrast, text resizing and spacing, and the
							reflowability of content.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Scripted Content and Forms</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="script/">scripting and forms topics</a> cover a range of issues related to
							adding interactive content to digital publications. Ensuring users can understand and 
							control this type of content is key to this area.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Fixed Layouts</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="fxl/">fixed layouts topics</a> delve into issues with creating content
							that is laid out on pages with fixed dimensions (i.e., the content does not reflow to
							fit the screen but stays where it is positioned). This type of content rarely meets
							accessibility standards, but there are measures that publishers can take to help
							improve its readability.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Synchronized Multimedia</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="sync-media/">synchronized multimedia topics</a> cover the creation of
							digital publications that provide synchronized text and audio playback, such as the
							EPUB 3 media overlays feature. These types of publications are often referred to as
							"read aloud" books.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Text to Speech</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="text-to-speech/">text-to-speech topics</a> cover technologies that aid
							in producing high-quality TTS playback.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>As the search engine is keyword based, it may return a lot of unrelated topics depending on what 
					you are looking for.</p>
