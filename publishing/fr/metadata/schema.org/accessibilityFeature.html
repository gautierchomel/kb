				<h3>Values</h3>

				<p>The following values are used to identify features of the content that are helpful for
					accessibility.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="format-note">
					<p class="label" id="format-note">Note</p>
					<p>Unless the metadata format used supports lists (e.g., JSON-LD), use a separate property 
						declaration for each feature. Do not merge the values into a single property using spaces,
						commas, or other delimiters.</p>
				</div>
				
				<section id="alternativeText">
					<h4>alternativeText</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>alternativeText</code> value is used to indicate that all images and other non-text
						content (e.g., audio and video) that is relevant to understanding a publication includes a
						text alternative.</p>

					<figure id="ex-alt-01">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Alternative text provided using the HTML <code>alt</code>
								attribute.</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-alt-01-src" class="prettyprint">&lt;img src="rabbit.jpg" alt="Bugs Bunny" /></pre>
					</figure>

					<p>Presentational images (i.e., that are only used for purely display or ornamentation purposes)
						are excluded from the requirement for alternative text, so not every image or instance of
						non-text content will have a text alternative when this property is set.</p>

					<figure id="ex-alt-02">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">A presentational image.</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-alt-02-src" class="prettyprint">&lt;img src="spacer.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" /></pre>
					</figure>

					<p>See the <a href="../../html/images-desc.html">Image Descriptions knowledge base page</a> for more
						information.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="annotations">
					<h4>annotations</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>annotations</code> value is used to indicate that a publication comes with
						explanatory annotations that improve the accessibility of the work (i.e., the value
						should not be used where the annotations are designed for general use, such as in
						annotated teacher's editions or exercises with explanatory notes).</p>
					
					<p>Examples of annotations with an accessibility benefit could include extended descriptions
						for images, plain language explanations of complex theorems, and text identifiers for
						visual cues.</p>

					<p>Annotations can either be part of text of a publication or can be authored in a separate
						technology such as Web Annotations.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="anno-note">
						<p id="anno-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/oa">Open Annotation in EPUB</a> specification
							is not currently known to be supported in any reading systems. A proposal is expected
							to be adopted to include <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/1109">accessible
								annotations in ARIA 1.3</a>, however. As a result, this value is rarely applicable
							to EPUB publications at this time.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Do not use this value for ruby annotations. See the <a href="#rubyAnnotations"
								><code>rubyAnnotations</code> value</a> instead.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="ARIA">
					<h4>ARIA</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>ARIA</code> value is used to indicate that ARIA roles are used to organize and
						improve the structural navigation of the publication (e.g., to identify key sections of
						the content and the purpose of hyperlinks).</p>
					
					<p>This value is used when <a 
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#document_structure_roles">Document Structure</a>, 
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles">Landmark</a>, <a 
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#live_region_roles">Live Region</a>, and <a 
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#window_roles">Window</a> roles are included.</p>
					
					<p>It is not intended for use when ARIA roles, states and properties are used to make
						custom controls accessible. The accessibility of custom controls is covered by the
						<a href="accessibilityControl.html"><code>accessibilityControl</code> property</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="audioDescription">
					<h4>audioDescription</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>audioDescription</code> value is used to indicate that description tracks are
						included for any video sources that require them.</p>

					<p>Audio descriptions differ from <a href="#captions">captions</a> and subtitles in that they
						describe the actions that are occurring in the video (i.e., they provide more information
						that just what is being spoken). Audio descriptions are most helpful when the content cannot
						be seen.</p>

					<figure id="ex-ad">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Audio description provided for an HTML video using a <code>track</code>
								element.</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-ad-src" class="prettyprint">&lt;video>
&lt;source src="speech.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
&lt;track src="description.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="en" label="English"/>
&lt;/video><code></code></pre>
					</figure>

					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="ad-note">
						<p id="ad-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>The HTML <code>audio</code> element cannot be used to render audio descriptions, as it
							does not provide a display area for them.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="bookmarks">
					<h4>bookmarks</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>bookmarks</code> value is used to indicate that a PDF includes a list of bookmarks.
						PDF bookmarks are like a <a href="#tableOfContents">table of contents</a> but may include
						destinations beyond the major headings. See the WCAG technique "<a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/pdf/PDF2.html">Creating bookmarks in PDF
							documents</a>" for more information.</p>

					<p>This value is not used in web-based formats like EPUB. Although reading systems provide a
						different kind of bookmarking feature, these bookmarks lack a common distribution format and
						are more of a general usability feature than an accessibility one.</p>
				</section>

					<section id="braille">
						<h4>braille</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>braille</code> value is used to indicate that either that a publication comes in a
							preformatted tactile form or that an alternative rendition in this medium is included.</p>

						<p>This value is primarily used by accessible republishers who produce HTML files using braille
							Unicode characters for the text.</p>

						<figure id="ex-brl">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">A braille-formatted paragraph.</p>
								<pre id="ex-brl-src" class="prettyprint brl"><code>&lt;p>&#x2820;&#x2809;&#x2801;&#x2807;&#x2807; &#x280f;&#x2811; &#x2820;&#x280a;&#x280e;&#x2813;&#x280f;&#x2809;&#x2807;&#x2807;&#x2832; &#8230;&lt;/p></code></pre>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="captions">
						<h4>captions</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>captions</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes captions for
							auditory content.</p>

						<p>Captions provide a transcription of the dialogue that is being spoken as well as describe
							any relevant sounds that are occurring (e.g., music playing, a phone ringing, etc.). They
							are intended to help when the audio is muted or cannot be fully heard.</p>

						<p>Captions are not the same as subtitles, which are strictly a transcription of the dialogue
							(and typically available in additional languages than that being spoken). They differ from
								<a href="#audioDescription">audio descriptions</a> in that they do not describe
							actions.</p>

						<figure id="ex-caption">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Captions provided for an HTML video using a <code>track</code>
									element.</p>
							</figcaption>
							<pre id="ex-caption-src" class="prettyprint">&lt;video>
   &lt;source src="speech.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
   &lt;track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en"
          label="English for the hard of hearing"/>
&lt;/video><code></code></pre>
						</figure>

						<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="cap-note">
							<p id="cap-note" class="label">Note</p>
							<p>The HTML <code>audio</code> element cannot be used to render captions, as it does not
								provide a display area for them.</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section id="ChemML">
						<h4>ChemML</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>ChemML</code> value is used to indicate that a publication contains chemical
							information (e.g., molecules and reactions) encoded using the ChemML markup language.</p>

						<p>This value is not typically used with publications at this time as there is no support for
							rendering ChemML in HTML.</p>

						<figure id="ex-cml">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Example of ChemML markup.</p>
								<pre id="ex-cml-src" class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;cml xmlns="http://www.xml-cml.org/schema" title="Chem sample" &#8230;>
   &lt;molecule id="mol" &#8230;>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/molecule>
&lt;/cml></code></pre>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="describedMath">
						<h4>describedMath</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>describedMath</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes textual
							descriptions for math equations.</p>

						<p>Text descriptions can be provided, for example, using language-specific technologies like the
							MathML <code>alttext</code> attribute. They can also be provided using the HTML
								<code>alt</code> attribute when only images are used. The value is a human readable
							equivalent.</p>

						<figure id="ex-dm">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Math description provided in an <code>alttext</code> attribute.</p>
							</figcaption>
							<pre id="ex-dm-src" class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"
      alttext="(mathml alt-text): y minus y 1 equals StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction left-parenthesis x minus x 1 right-parenthesis"></code></pre>
						</figure>

						<p>This property is complementary to the <a href="#MathML"><code>MathML</code></a> and <a
								href="#latex"><code>latex</code></a> properties, as the inclusion of either MathML- or
							latex-formatted equations does not infer that text descriptions will be available.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="displayTransformability">
						<h4>displayTransformability</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>displayTransformability</code> property is used to indicate that a publication does
							not restrict the ability of users to modify the display of textual content (e.g., to change
							the font family, font size, line height and word spacing).</p>

						<p>In order to set this value, all text content must be encoded as text (i.e., there must not be
							any images of text). In addition, absolute length units must not be used in the styling
							(e.g., pixels and points).</p>

						<p>It is not required that a publication provide the means of transforming the text. It is
							expected that users who require this feature will have a reading system that with display
							transform options.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="highContrastAudio">
						<h4>highContrastAudio</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>highContrastAudio</code> value is used when a publication contains audio with
							speech and there is low or no background noise. Low background noise is defined as a minimum
							20dB difference between foreground speech and background sounds (see <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#low-or-no-background-audio">WCAG success criterion
								1.4.7</a>).</p>

						<p>High contrast audio is helpful for users who are hard of hearing and have trouble separating
							foreground speech from background noise.</p>

						<p>The requirement for low or no background noise does not apply to musical works where the
							background sound is integral to the presentation.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="highContrastDisplay">
						<h4>highContrastDisplay</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>highContrastDisplay</code> value is used to indicate that there is at least a 7:1
							contrast ratio between the foreground text and the background, including for images of text
							(see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-enhanced">WCAG success criterion
								1.4.6</a>).</p>

						<p>High contrast display is helpful for users with moderately low vision or with color
							deficiencies.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="index">
						<h4>index</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>index</code> value is used to indicate that a publication contains one or more
							indexes of the content (e.g., a topical index or index of names).</p>

						<p>Indexes allow users who cannot see the text or have difficulty following it to find and
							return to subjects more easily.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="largePrint">
						<h4>largePrint</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>largePrint</code> value is used to indicate that the text of a publication has been
							formatted to meet large print guidelines. Large print guidelines vary from region to region,
							but generally require a point size ranging from 14 to 18, use of sans serif fonts, and
							increased word spacing.</p>

						<p>The use of this value should not be confused with <a href="#displayTransformability">display
								transformability</a>. The text must be styled by default for large print reading to use
							this value, not that it can be modified for large print reading.</p>

						<p>Large print is still predominantly a print medium, so outside of accessible republishing it
							is not common to use this value.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="latex">
						<h4>latex</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>latex</code> value is used to indicate that a publication contains math equations
							formatted using the LaTeX typesetting system.</p>

						<p>LaTeX equations can retain semantic information about math equations that is not always
							available in other formats (e.g., <a href="#MathML">presentational MathML</a>) making them
							easier to understand.</p>

						<p>The ability to read LaTeX equations often requires being able to export the data to another
							program, however, as LaTeX does not natively render in Web-based formats like EPUB. As a
							result, it is not commonly found at this time.</p>

						<figure id="ex-latex">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">A latex-formatted equation.</p>
							</figcaption>
							<pre id="ex-latext-src" class="prettyprint"><code>\begin{equation} f(x)=(x+a)(x+b) \end{equation}</code></pre>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="longDescription">
						<h4>longDescription</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>longDescription</code> value is used to indicate that all complex content (images,
							tables, charts, equations, etc.) include an extended description of their purpose.</p>

						<p>Complexity is determined by whether <a href="#alternativeText">alternative text</a> alone is
							sufficient to convey the full information of the content (e.g., for images and charts), or
							whether the structure is likely to be understood by someone who cannot see it (e.g., for
							tables). See the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111#non-text-content"
								>techniques for WCAG success criterion 1.1.1</a> for more information on when extended
							descriptions are needed.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../html/images-desc.html">Image Descriptions knowledge base page</a> for more
							information.</p>

						<figure id="ex-ld-01">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Long description included in an HTML <code>details</code> element.</p>
							</figcaption>
							<pre id="ex-ld-01-src" class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;figure id="fig01">

      &lt;details>
         &lt;summary>Description&lt;/summary>
         &lt;p>The chart shows a typical &#8230;&lt;/p>
      &lt;/details>

&lt;p id="img-desc" hidden="">The 47 spheres are shown &#8230;&lt;/p></code></pre>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="MathML">
						<h4>MathML</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>MathML</code> value is used to indicate that the MathML markup language has been
							used to encode the mathematical equations. For Web-based formats like EPUB, Presentational
							MathML is used to encode the content as it can be displayed in a growing number of reading
							systems and browsers.</p>

						<p>Although Presentational MathML often lacks important semantic information that is only
							available in Content MathML, it is supported by assistive technologies which allow users to
							more easily navigate and understand the content.</p>

						<p>The <code>MathML</code> value is often paired with the <a href="#describedMath">describedMath
								value</a> when fallback descriptions are provided.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../html/mathml.html">MathML knowledge base page</a> for more
							information.</p>

						<figure id="ex-mml">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">MathML equation for definition of a circle.</p>

      &lt;/msup>
   &lt;/mrow>
&lt;/math></pre>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="none">
						<h4>none</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>none</code> value is used to indicate that a publication does not include any
							accessibility features.</p>

						<p>This value exists so that there is no ambiguity about whether a publication does not contain
							any accessibility features or whether it was never checked for them.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="pageNavigation">
						<h4>pageNavigation</h4>
					
						<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="note-hd">
							<p class="label" id="note-hd">Note</p>
							<p>This value has been proposed for inclusion but has not yet been accepted. See <a
									href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues/12">issue 12</a> for more
								information.</p>
						</div>

						<p>The <code>pageNavigation</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes a page
							list.</p>

						<p>The page list is a navigation aid that provides a list of links to static page break
							locations (i.e., that do not change based on screen size or when the display is
							transformed). The static page breaks typically represent <a href="#printPageNumbers">print
								page numbers</a>, but publishers sometimes insert static locations in purely digital
							works to ease coordination of locations.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of a page list is particularly useful where mixed print-digital environments
							(such as in educational settings) are anticipated, as the page list allows digital users to
							coordinate their locations with print users. In these cases, the <a href="#printPageNumbers"
									><code>printPageNumbers</code></a> value is also set.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../navigation/pagelist.html">page navigation knowledge base page</a> for
							more information.</p>

						<figure id="ex-pgl">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">EPUB 3 page list.</p>

      &lt;li>&lt;a href="intro.xhtml#pg2">2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/ol>
&lt;/nav></code></pre>
						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="printPageNumbers">
						<h4>printPageNumbers</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>printPageNumbers</code> value is used to indicate that static print page break
							locations are included in the text.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page break markers from a print source allows users to identify where they
							are in a digital publication relative to its print equivalent. The page break markers are
							typically accompanied by a <a href="#pageList">page list</a> that allows users to quickly
							navigate to a specific location.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../navigation/pagelist.html">page navigation knowledge base page</a> for
							more information.</p>

						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="readingOrder">
						<h4>readingOrder</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>readingOrder</code> value is used to indicate that there is a logical reading order
							to the text of a publication.</p>

						<p>The logical reading order is the progression from one element of content to the next (e.g., a
							heading for a chapter is followed by the first paragraph and so on). When elements are out
							of order in the markup and styled to appear linear, assistive technologies will present them
							to users in the incorrect order.</p>

						<p>The logical reading order is also established by ensuring that primary content can be
							distinguished from secondary. The use of HTML elements like <code>figure</code> and
								<code>aside</code> helps identify secondary content, allowing users to skip over it if
							they choose.</p>

						<p>Fixed-layout publications tend to be the most problematic due to the fixed positioning of
							elements and having to represent secondary content that spans two pages, but it is possible
							for fixed layouts to have a logical reading progression if care is taken.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../html/order.html">logical reading order knowledge base page</a> for
							more information.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="rubyAnnotations">
						<h4>rubyAnnotations</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>rubyAnnotations</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes ruby
							annotations.</p>

						<p>Ruby annotations are most commonly used to provide pronunciation guides for Chinese, Japanese
							and Korean texts.</p>

						<figure id="ex-ruby">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Ruby annotation in HTML.</p>

						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="signLanguage">
						<h4>signLanguage</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>signLanguage</code> value is used to indicate that sign language interpretation is
							included for any auditory content.</p>

						<p>Although <a href="#captions">captions</a> and <a href="#audioDescription">audio
								descriptions</a> serve a similar purpose, many readers who are deaf prefer sign
							language interpretation as it is their primary means of communication so quicker and
							easier to follow.</p>

						<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="sl-note">
							<p id="sl-note" class="label">Note</p>
							<p>HTML does not offer a simple mechanism for synchronizing sign language interpretation
								with a video. If interpretation is not part of the video stream, authors will have to
								provide a separate video overlay or play interpretation side-by-side with the video.</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section id="structuralNavigation">
						<h4>structuralNavigation</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>structuralNavigation</code> value is used to indicate that all headings are
							properly marked up.</p>

						<p>The use of headings tags, and their correct numbering, allows users of assistive technologies
							to quickly move through the different levels of the book without having to traverse the
							table of contents.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../html/headings.html">HTML headings knowledge base page</a> for more
							information.</p>

					<section id="synchronizedAudioText">
						<h4>synchronizedAudioText</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>synchronizedAudioText</code> value is used to indicate that synchronized playback
							of prerecorded audio with text highlighting is available.</p>

						<p>Synchronized playback can help new language learners follow the text and hear how it is
							pronounced, for example, but is also helpful for users who need only one or the other
							modality. Audio playback can be used to provide an audiobook experience for users who are
							blind or have low vision, while text highlighting can help users who have difficulty
							following lines of text.</p>

						<p>Text and audio synchronization is typically provided using the SMIL language (e.g., in DAISY
							talking books and EPUB 3 media overlays).</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../sync-media/overlays.html">media overlays knowledge base page</a> for
							more information.</p>

					<section id="tableOfContents">
						<h4>tableOfContents</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>tableOfContents</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes a
							table of contents for navigating the major sections of the work.</p>

						<p>The table of contents is an important aid for navigating a publication for those who cannot
							see the text.</p>

						<p>The table of contents is an integral part of formats like EPUB so is always expected to be
							present. Authors still need to ensure that the table of contents is sufficiently complete
							(e.g., includes at least all the top-level headings), otherwise it is incorrect to set this
							value.</p>

						<p>See the <a href="../../navigation/toc.html">table of contents knowledge base page</a> for
							more information.</p>

						</figure>
					</section>

					<section id="taggedPDF">
						<h4>taggedPDF</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>taggedPDF</code> value is used to indicate that a PDF includes accessibility tags
							to improve its readability.</p>

						<p>Accessibility tags are a way of labeling the components of a PDF to try and retain some of
							the semantics that are otherwise only visually present. They are a key part of the PDF
							Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA) standard.</p>

						<p>This value is not relevant to Web-based publication formats such as EPUB.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="tactileGraphic">
						<h4>tactileGraphic</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>tactileGraphic</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes access
							to tactile graphics.</p>
						
						<p>As EPUB reading systems typically cannot present tactile graphics to users, hyperlinks to
							downloadable graphics are a common way to make these available. It is not required that the
							graphics be rendered in the publication for this value to apply.</p>

						<p>It is not common for this value to be used outside of accessible republishing, however, due
							to the specialized work required to create tactile graphics.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="tactileObject">
						<h4>tactileObject</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>tactileObject</code> value is used to indicate that a publication includes tactile
							objects.</p>

						<p>Due to the need to print tactile objects, hyperlinks to downloadable files are the most
							common way to make these available.</p>
						
						<p>It is not common for this value to be used outside of accessible republishing, however, due
							to the specialized work required to create tactile objects.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="timingControl">
						<h4>timingControl</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>timingControl</code> value is used to indicate that a publication contains content
							with timed interactions (e.g., a quiz or game with a time limit) and that the timing can be
							controlled by the user.</p>

						<p>As users with disabilities may require additional time to complete tasks, they need to be
							able to disable, adjust or extend time limits.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="transcript">
						<h4>transcript</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>transcript</code> value is used to indicate that transcripts are provided for any
							auditory content.</p>

						<p>Transcripts allow users who cannot hear the audio or have difficulty following the speech to
							read what was spoken. They are an alternative to embedding <a href="#audioDescription">audio
								descriptions</a> or <a href="#captions">captions</a>, which may not always be
							playable.</p>

						<figure id="ex-tr">
							<figcaption>
								<p class="label">Adding a link to a transcript</p>
							</figcaption>
							<pre id="ex-tr-src" class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;audio src="speech.mp3"/>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="transcript.html">Read a text transcript of the speech&lt;/a>&lt;/p></code></pre>
						</figure>
						
						<p>Although including a transcript as part of the EPUB publication is the best way to ensure
							its availability, hyperlinks to external transcripts are also acceptable (e.g., publishers
							may have a common web-based location for all their videos and transcripts).</p>
					</section>

					<section id="ttsMarkup">
						<h4>ttsMarkup</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>ttsMarkup</code> value is used to indicate that a publication's text has been
							enhanced with additional phonetic markup to improve text-to-speech (TTS) playback.</p>

						<p>Synthetic speech engines often struggle to render complex words and heteronyms (words that
							are spelled the same but sound different). The result is that it can be very difficult for
							users who cannot see the text to understand what is being read out.</p>

						<p>The <a href="../../text-to-speech/ssml.html">SSML markup language</a> allows the phonetic
							renderings of words to be included in the markup of publications to improve rendering, for
							example. PLS pronunciation lexicons similarly allow libraries of phonetic pronunciations to
							be attached to HTML content.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="unlocked">
						<h4>unlocked</h4>
					
						<p>The <code>unlocked</code> value is used to indicate that no digital rights management (DRM)
							or other content restriction protocols are applied to the content.</p>

						<p>DRM schemes are often applied to digital publications to protect them from being copied, but
							these schemes, or the rights applied to the content, can sometimes interfere with the
							ability of assistive technologies to access or play back the text.</p>

						<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="un-note">
							<p id="un-note" class="label">Note</p>
							<p>It is often vendors who apply DRM schemes to publications before distributing them to
								users. As a result, before setting this value, authors need to ensure that the
								publication will not subsequently have DRM applied. The pubication has to be guaranteed
								to be unlocked after distribution.</p>
