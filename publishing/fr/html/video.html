				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>When including video clips, ensure that the native user agent controls are enabled by default (i.e.,
					by setting the <code>controls</code> attribute on the <code>video</code> element). This practice
					ensures that the controls are accessible even if scripting is not available. If you define your own
					custom controls, disable the native controls by JavaScript so they remain available in user agent
					that do not support scripting.</p>
				
				<p>Providing a label for videos ensures that users can understand the purpose of the video before
					choosing whether to view it. The poster image that authors can specify to provide a snapshot of the
					video for visual readers, for example, is not available to users who are blind. The label is the
					only means of understanding the content without downloading it for these users. For users on mobile
					devices, especially with high bandwidth costs, this information can save them both time and
					money.</p>
				
				<p>In terms of providing alternatives, WCAG requires multiple options for video content to address the
					needs of different user groups:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Transcripts and/or audio description tracks for users who are blind or have low vision.</li>
					<li>Captions for users who cannot hear the video.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>WCAG refers to transcripts as "media alternatives" because they cannot be a simple listing of
					the spoken dialogue. The transcripts must include descriptions of the actions and any other
					important events in the video.</p>
				
				<p>Progressing from level A to AA also increases the requirement. Transcripts are not sufficient to
					for video with audio at level AA, for example, only an audio description track is sufficient.</p>
					
				<p>Although the <code>video</code> element allows child content for fallback purposes, such content is
					not intended to serve as an accessible alternative. The user agent only makes this content
					available to the user if it does not support the <code>video</code> element (e.g., in EPUB 2 user
					agents).</p>
				
				<p>It is also important to consider that users need to be able to hear the audio produced by their
					assistive technologies (e.g., a screen reader). Automatically playing a video with audio interferes
					with their ability to hear the text, for example, so unless the clip only plays for three seconds
					or less, the user must be able to disable playback or mute the volume without also muting their
					assistive technology (i.e., the system audio control is not sufficient to meet this requirement as
					it will raise and lower all audio in synchronicity).</p>
